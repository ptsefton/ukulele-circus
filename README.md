## Welcome to (Luck Phil's) Ukulele Circus

There are a few Ukulele Circuses in the world, this one is Lucky Phil's. We know you're wondering: why is Phil Lucky? Has as a Ukulele Circus, that's why. This goes some way to making up for his other challenges and disappointments in life. Although he is a newly-minted grandfather, so that's something.

## Not tested on animals

Many modern circuses have no animals, and this one is no different. We also have no clowns, no acrobats, nor do we have any jugglers, although we do have a few down-market ring masters.

## OK, ok, I want to be Lucky Like Philâ„¢ how can I get involved?

The Ukulele circus puts up its tent on the first Friday of every month at the Blue Mountains Hotel in Lawson (that's near Sydney, in Australia).

If you'd like to play with us, start by coming along to the regular Thursday night Uke session at the New Ivanhoe Hotel in Blackheath (about an hour further from Sydney), or for a folksier sing-along with an Irish lilt join us for a Guiness at the Ori in Springwood (a bit closer to Sydney).
