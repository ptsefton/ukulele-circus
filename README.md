## Welcome to (Luck Phil's) Ukulele Circus

There are a few Ukulele Circuses in the world, this one is Lucky Phil's. Why is Phil Lucky? Has as a Ukulele Circus. This goes some way to making up for his other challenges and dissapointments in life. 

## Not tested on animals

Many modern circuses have no animals, and this one is no different. We also have no clowns, no acrobats and no jugglers, although we do have a few down-market ring masters.

## OK, how can I get involved

The Ukulele circus plays on the first Friday of every month at the Blue Mountain hotel.

If you'd like to play with us, start by coming along to the regular Thursday night session at the New Ivanhoe Hotel in Blackheath.
