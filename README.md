## Welcome to (Lucky Phil's) Ükulele Circus

There are a few Ukulele Circuses in the world, this one is Lucky Phil's. We know you're wondering: why is Phil Lucky? He has as a Ükülele Circus, that's why. This goes some way to making up for his other challenges and disappointments in life. He is a newly-minted grandfather, though, so that's something.


## Ükülele Circus: Not tested on animals!!!!

Many modern circuses have no animals, and this one is no different. We also have no clowns, no acrobats, nor do we have any jugglers, although we do have a few down-market ring masters. Yeah, alright, maybe there's a clown or two.

NOTE: We play ukes and we're based in the Blue Mountains. **But this is not the Blue Mountains Ukulele Group**. 

The Ukulele Circus is proud to be sponsored by [Katoomba Music](http://katoombamusic.com.au/), a great locally owned shop with a fantastic range of ukes. They even have other weird stuff like "guitars" and "banjos" and "amps" and "accessories", if for some unfathomable reason the uke is not fulfilling all your desires. Katoomba Music also have a [gig guide](http://katoombamusic.com.au/katoomba-music-gig-guide/)☥ covering events in the Blue Mountains.

☥ NOTE: Some events listed on Katoomba Music gig guide may NOT contain ukes.

## Sessions


If you'd like to play with us, start by coming along to the regular Thursday night uke sessions at the New Ivanhoe Hotel in Blackheath and the Grandview in Wentworth Falls.
