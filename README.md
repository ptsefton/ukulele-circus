## Welcome to (Lucky Phil's) Ükulele Circus

There are a few Ukulele Circuses in the world, this one is Lucky Phil's. We know you're wondering: why is Phil Lucky? He has as a Ükulele Circus, that's why. This goes some way to making up for his other challenges and disappointments in life. He is a newly-minted grandfather, though, so that's something.

## What's on? (Circus and friends...)

## Ükulele Circus: Not tested on animals!!!!

Many modern circuses have no animals, and this one is no different. We also have no clowns, no acrobats, nor do we have any jugglers, although we do have a few down-market ring masters. Yeah, alright, maybe there's a clown or two.

## OK, OK, I want to be Lucky Like Phil™ how can I get involved?

The Ükulele Circus pitches its tent on the first Friday of every month at the Blue Mountains Hotel in Lawson (that's near Sydney, in Australia).

If you'd like to play with us, start by coming along to the regular Thursday night uke session at the New Ivanhoe Hotel in Blackheath (about half an hour further from Sydney than Lawson), or for a folksier sing-along with an Irish lilt join us for a Guiness at the Ori in Springwood (a bit closer to Sydney).

Join our Google Group [mailing list] to get notified of what's going on, or to get in contact with us. There's also a [Facebook page].
